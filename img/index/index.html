            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>AR Civitas is an application that use augmented reality (AR)  to help you navigate when walking. AR Civitas is focusing on the Lebuh Cannon (“Boy on Chair” mural) to Armenian Street Ghaut (“The Giant Cat” mural) at the heritage area of Penang which is also a tourist attraction. AR Civitas provide the user with the live feed from the user’s camera to overlay walking directions on top of the real world and help the user figure out which way to go.  Arrows and directions are placed in the real world to guide your way, helping you identify exactly where to make those tricky turns or which way to start your journey.  
                Penang heritage area is mostly covered by the colourful mural that attract everyone that see it so we decided to add another function in AR Civitas that can scan the mural for a further detail with description. The user can gain extra knowledge from it and understand the message behind those art. </p>

            <h1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
            <ul>
                <li >User don’t understand paper-based map
                    Every visitor or tourist that come to the heritage area can used the maps provided as a reference. Some user find it hard to read and understand which way to take because some part of the paper-based map is crowded with images and the text on it is quite small. </li>
                <li>Risk to the road user 
                    The heritage area of Penang is popular as one of the busy road, some of the people who visited the area used to ride bicycle some of them walking. If the user used the paper-based maps, the user need to read the map properly to understand which road to take. Reading a map in the busy road expose the user to involve in accident and it also put the user in dangerous. </li>
                <li>User not interested in art 
                    Every visitor or tourist that come and enjoy themselves at the heritage area will find that most of the wall is covered with a beautiful mural but some of them does not interested in it because they don’t have much info about it so they did not appreciate the art.</li>
                 <li>Heritage area road signboard not clear 
                    User find it hard to recognize their current location because it difficult to find the signboard of the road and some of the signboard is difficult to read because of the vandalism behavior, they stick the advertisement on the signboard to let people around it noticed their advertisement</li>

                    <h1>Objective</h1>
                  <ul>
                      <li>To make the user’s life easier as they help the user navigate when walking as the user know precisely which road to take because AR can point in the right direction so the users are heading the right way</li>
                      <li>To identify the current location of the user with superimposing direction and details on the display rather than just presenting the user with a map </li>
                      <li>To add knowledge and information to the user that come to the heritage area so they will be more interested to discover and understand each mural that painted with beautiful color </li>
